                        <p>In the unlikely event that Vyomarr is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of assets, your personal data may be transferred as part of that transaction. However, we will ensure that any acquiring party is bound by the same privacy commitments outlined in this policy. We will provide you with advance notice of any such transfer and inform you of any changes to how your data will be handled. You will have the opportunity to delete your account before any such transfer if you choose not to continue with the new entity.</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Protecting your personal information is one of our highest priorities. We implement a comprehensive security framework that includes both technical and organizational measures to safeguard your data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our technical security measures include industry-standard encryption for data both in transit and at rest, secure server configurations, regular security updates and patches, multi-factor authentication for our internal systems, and continuous monitoring for suspicious activities. We use advanced firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and employ security professionals who regularly assess and improve our defenses.</p>
                    
                    <p>From an organizational standpoint, we maintain strict access controls ensuring that only authorized personnel can access your data on a need-to-know basis. All our employees undergo comprehensive privacy and security training, and we conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.</p>
                    
                    <p>However, we want to be transparent with you: no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is completely secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data and continuously invest in improving our security measures, we cannot guarantee absolute security. We encourage you to also take steps to protect your account, such as using strong, unique passwords and keeping your login credentials confidential.</p>

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>We believe in retaining your personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, comply with legal requirements, and protect our legitimate business interests. Our retention approach is systematic and considers various factors to determine appropriate retention periods.</p>
                    
                    <p>For account information, we retain your personal data as long as your account remains active and for a reasonable period afterward to accommodate potential account reactivation. When you delete your account, we initiate a deletion process, though some information may be retained for a limited time to comply with legal obligations or resolve disputes.</p>
                    
                    <p>Technical and usage data is typically retained for shorter periods, usually between 12-24 months, depending on the type of data and its purpose. This includes server logs, analytics data, and similar technical information. Marketing and communication data is retained until you unsubscribe from our communications or delete your account.</p>
                    
                    <p>Certain types of data may need to be retained longer due to legal requirements, such as financial records for tax purposes or information related to legal proceedings. In all cases, once the retention period expires, we securely delete or anonymize the data so it can no longer be associated with you personally.</p>

                        <p>You can request that we delete your personal data in certain circumstances, such as when the data is no longer necessary for the original purpose, you withdraw your consent, or the data has been unlawfully processed. When you delete your account, we'll remove your personal information from our active systems, though some data may be retained for legal compliance purposes.</p>

This includes unsubscribing from marketing emails, changing your cookie preferences, or withdrawing consent for specific data processing activities. Withdrawing consent won't affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</p>
